# JobAppChromeExtension

## Client

Client contains the chrome extension source.

## Server

Server contains the backend python service

## How it's made
1. Followed the instructions from [here](https://dev.to/rgolawski/building-chrome-extension-with-vite-47bh) to initialise the chrome extension.
2. Moved the resulting files into the `client` folder so everything reloated to this project can live in the same rep
3. Investigated using NX to manage the mono repo environment, but the config quickly became more cumbersome than it's worth
4. Started designing the initial architecture. Prioritising POC rather than scale since this is mostly for fun, we're keeping it simple with just one server handling requests.
5. Based on [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/build-qa-bot-over-private-data-openai-langchain-leo-wang/), we should be able to build something where each user has their own document that we add to over time.
