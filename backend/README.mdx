# Backend

## Notes

1. Initialised project with virtualenv
2. Followed the [FastAPI getting started guide](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
3. For authentication, I wanted to pass the google auth token from the browser to the server. [This guide](https://nilsdebruin.medium.com/fastapi-google-as-an-external-authentication-provider-3a527672cf33) described how to do that! I used a domain I already had to crack on with this.
4. For setting up env config, [I used this fastAPI guide](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/settings/)

## Useful commands
Activate the virtualenv:
```source backend_env/bin/activate```

Start the server in watch mode
```uvicorn main:app --reload```
