# background

* Background holds the main logic.
* Persistent background pages always run.
* Event pages only open when the extension is opened and closed

## Design

Background script acts like the server to the content scripts.
E.g. content script will send message to background like `{type: GetAnswer, question: questionString}`
Background script then would handle the relevant API calls to external services, before responding to the content script with some result (if any)
